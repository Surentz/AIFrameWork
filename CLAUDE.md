# AIFrameWork

.NET backend + React frontend, Clean Architecture, single repo.

## Versions

| | Version |
|---|---|
| .NET SDK | 10.0.400 |
| Target framework | net10.0 |
| Node | 24.20.0 |
| React | 19.2.8 |
| Vite | 8.2.2 |

Verified 2026-09-03 from `dotnet --list-sdks`, `node --version`, and `frontend/package.json`
(post-install, resolved versions). The target framework was pinned when the solution was
scaffolded. React and Vite were pinned once the workspace was created, read from the
generated `package.json` — not from memory.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/Domain` | Entities, value objects, domain events, domain exceptions |
| `src/Application` | Use cases, ports, `Result<T>`, validators |
| `src/Infrastructure` | EF Core, repositories, external clients |
| `src/Api` | Controllers, DTOs, exception handling, composition root |
| `frontend` | Vite + React workspace |
| `tests` | Test projects, one per layer |

## The dependency rule

Dependencies point inward. This is enforced by `.claude/hooks/dependency-rule.ps1`,
which blocks the edit rather than warning about it.

| From ↓ / To → | Domain | Application | Infrastructure | Api |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain** | — | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Application** | ✓ | — | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Infrastructure** | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✗ |
| **Api** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ DI only | — |

> The `Api → Infrastructure` cell is the one row the hook does **not** enforce: nothing
> distinguishes a `services.AddScoped<>()` registration from a controller reaching into a
> repository, so "DI only" is carried by review and `dotnet-reviewer`. Every other cell blocks.

`Domain` additionally may not reference `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`,
`Microsoft.AspNetCore`, `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`, `System.Data`,
or `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`.

## Non-negotiables

- **Warnings are errors.** All three sources — compiler, analyzers, build — see
  `Directory.Build.props`. Fix diagnostics; do not suppress them without a justification comment.
  Repo-wide exemptions live in `.editorconfig` as `severity = none` rules — that file is the
  place to look for what's off and why. Everything narrower is a local `#pragma warning
  disable`/`restore` pair at the point of use, and every one of those carries a justification
  comment right above it explaining why the rule's intent doesn't apply there (see, for example,
  `src/Application/Abstractions/Messaging.cs` and `tests/Infrastructure.Tests/Persistence/
  PostgresFixture.cs`). Grep for `#pragma warning disable` if you need the current, exact list —
  it grows as new sites are justified, so no count is kept here.
- **Nullable is enabled.** A missing null check does not compile.
- **`required` keyword in `Domain`, never `[Required]`.** DataAnnotations belong on `Api` DTOs.
- **Never `catch (Exception)`.** The global `IExceptionHandler` receives it as a parameter.
  CA1031 is an error everywhere except one file-scoped exemption in `.editorconfig`, for the
  outbox's `BackgroundService` pumps, which have no such parameter and must not die mid-loop.
  `throw;`, never `throw ex;`.
- **Never hand-edit an applied EF migration.** Add a new one.
- **No secrets in `appsettings*.json`.** Use `dotnet user-secrets` or environment variables.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/feature <name>` | Scaffold a feature across all four layers, with tests |
| `/react-feature <name>` | Scaffold a React feature |
| `/verify` | Build, test, and lint both stacks |
| `/adr <title>` | Record an architecture decision |

## More context

Each layer has its own `CLAUDE.md`, loaded when you work in that directory.
Conventions live in the `dotnet-conventions`, `dotnet-testing`, `react-conventions`,
and `react-testing` skills.
